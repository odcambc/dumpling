# File definitions:
# These files are relative to the base snakemake invocation directory, as well.
# experiment_file: CSV file containing the experiment metadata for describing
#                  the experiment structure and the mapping to each file.
#                  This file must contain the following columns:
#                     sample: Unique sample name
#                     condition: Condition name

#                     tile: Tile number (for tiled sequencing)
#                     file: File name prefix (e.g, without "_R1_001.fastq.gz" and
#                           "_R2_001.fastq.gz" for paired-end reads from standard
#                           Illumina sequencing)
#                   This file is validated against the schema in "schemas/experiments.schema.yaml"
#
# reference: Reference fasta file name. This must be a nucleotide fasta file!
#
# variants_file: CSV file containing the variants to be analyzed. This file must contain the following columns:
#                     count: Number of reads with this variant (initialized to 0)
#                     pos: Amino acid position of the residue in the reference sequence
#                     mutation_type: Type of mutation (e.g. "S" for synonymous, "M" for missense substitution,
#                                    "D" for deletion, "I" for insertion, "X" for nonsense)
#                     name: Name of the variant (e.g. "A123T")
#                     codon: Codon of the specific variant (empty for deletions)
#                     mutation: Mutation subtype of the variant (identical to mutation_type for substitutions,
#                                including length for indels: e.g. "D_3" for a 3 amino acid deletion, "I_1" for
#                                a 1 amino acid insertion)
#                     length: Total length of codons changed in variant
#                     hgvs: HGVS notation of the protein-level variant ('p.(V134_S136del)' for a 
#                           deletion of the three codons from position 134 to 136, or 
#                           'p.(I11_V12insG)' for an insertion of a Gly after Ile 11)
#
# OPTIONAL:
# oligo_file:  CSV file containing the oligos used for generating the library, as in DIMPLE. This may be used
#             to generate the variants_file if it does not already exist.
